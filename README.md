## 💡 Featured Project
### NoteTube — Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS (EC2), Nginx, Docker, OpenAI, AssemblyAI
- **Deployed and Dockerized a Django application on AWS EC2 (Linux)**, running Gunicorn under systemd for process supervision and automatic restarts, enabling stable production serving and simpler, repeatable deployments.
- **Configured Nginx** as an **HTTP(S) reverse proxy** to route traffic to **Gunicorn**, serving static assets directly and enabling proxy caching to **reduce application server load** and **improve request-handling reliability**.
- Reduced average API route latency by **85.9%** (from 313ms → 44ms) by implementing **Redis caching** for high-traffic **user/session** reads, cutting repeated **PostgreSQL** hits.

**What this shows:** full lifecycle backend engineering—built a Django web app from local development to a production deployment on AWS, containerized the application with Docker for consistent environments and repeatable releases, ran Gunicorn as the application server behind Nginx (reverse proxy + static asset delivery), and improved scalability and reliability by using Redis caching to reduce PostgreSQL load and cut endpoint latency.
