🎓 Full-Stack Software Engineering Intern @ Deepiri <br>

## 💡 Featured Projects
### NoteTube — Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS (EC2), Nginx, Docker, OpenAI, AssemblyAI
- Deployed a Dockerized Django application on Linux-based AWS EC2, configuring security groups and SSH access, and securing HTTPS traffic via TLS termination at Nginx with Let’s Encrypt.
- Increased throughput by 20%, reduced average latency by 16.5%, and lowered p95 latency by 19% by implementing Nginx response caching and iterative performance tuning with k6 load testing.
- Reduced API latency 85.9% (313ms to 44ms) by integrating Redis caching for high-traffic user and session queries.
- Implemented GitHub Actions CI, automating tests and formatting, reducing manual validation by 90%.

**What this shows:** full lifecycle backend engineering—built a Django web app from local development to a production deployment on AWS, containerized the application with Docker for consistent environments and repeatable releases, ran Gunicorn as the application server behind Nginx (reverse proxy + static asset delivery), and improved scalability and reliability by using Redis caching to reduce PostgreSQL load and cut endpoint latency.

## ⚡ RU Valentine V2 — Python, FastAPI, Pydantic, PostgreSQL
- Accomplished secure user authentication and access control by implementing Google SSO using OAuth 2.0 and OIDC with PKCE, ID token verification, hosted-domain enforcement, and JWT-based protection for REST APIs.
- Achieved sub-400 ms search latency with 99.9% uptime for a student-matching platform serving 2,000+ Rutgers users by designing a weighted-vector compatibility algorithm leveraging 70-dimensional embeddings.

**What this shows:** full-stack backend system design—implemented secure OAuth 2.0 authentication with JWT-based session handling, designed a scalable vector-based matching algorithm using **70-dimensional embeddings**, and built a production-ready platform capable of serving **2,000+** real users with **sub-400ms** search latency and high uptime.
