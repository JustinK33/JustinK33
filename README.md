## 💡 Featured Projects
### NoteTube — Python, Django, PostgreSQL, Redis, AWS (EC2), Nginx, Docker, OpenAI, AssemblyAI
- Implemented HTTPS with TLS termination at Nginx (Let’s Encrypt, automated renewal) while deploying a Dockerized Django app on AWS EC2 using Docker Compose and Gunicorn.
- Increased throughput **20% **and reduced latency **16.5% (19% p95)** by implementing** Nginx caching** and load-tested performance optimizations with **k6**.
- **Reduced average API route latency by **85.9%** (from 313ms → 44ms) by implementing **Redis caching** for high-traffic **user/session** reads, cutting repeated **PostgreSQL** hits.**

**What this shows:** full lifecycle backend engineering—built a Django web app from local development to a production deployment on AWS, containerized the application with Docker for consistent environments and repeatable releases, ran Gunicorn as the application server behind Nginx (reverse proxy + static asset delivery), and improved scalability and reliability by using Redis caching to reduce PostgreSQL load and cut endpoint latency.

## ⚡ RU Valentine V2 — Python, FastAPI, Oauth V2
Designing and building a school-wide matchmaking platform for Rutgers students, including auth, survey flows, matching logic, and announcement pages, handling real student sign-ups and live traffic.

- Implemented **Google SSO with OAuth 2.0/OIDC**, including PKCE, ID token verification, hosted-domain enforcement, and **JWT-based authentication** for protected REST APIs.
- Built a **weighted-vector** compatibility algorithm for a student-matching system serving **2,000+** Rutgers users.
- Architected a scalable matching platform with **70-dimensional embeddings**, achieving **<400 ms search latency** and **99.9% uptime**.

**What this shows:** full-stack backend system design—implemented secure OAuth 2.0 authentication with JWT-based session handling, designed a scalable vector-based matching algorithm using **70-dimensional embeddings**, and built a production-ready platform capable of serving **2,000+** real users with **sub-400ms** search latency and high uptime.
