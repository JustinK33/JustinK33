🎓 Computer Science @ Rutgers University (Class of 2028) <br>
🚀 Backend developer | API specialist | Cloud computing enthusiast | AI/ML engineer <br>
🎓 Full-Stack Software Engineering Intern @ Deepiri <br>

## 💡 Featured Projects
### 🧠 Team Brain — Python, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Pydantic, SQLAlchemy, Redis (CURRENT)
- Secure REST API with **JWT** access & refresh tokens (login, token refresh, protected routes, logout-style token invalidation pattern)
- **PostgreSQL** + **SQLAlchemy ORM** with relational models for users, spaces, memberships, and messages (ownership, roles, and constraints)
- **Redis caching** for frequently accessed user/session data to reduce database hits and improve response times
- **SlowAPI** rate limiting using Redis storage for **per-user and per-IP limiting**, protecting message endpoints from abuse

**What this shows:** real-world backend concerns—stateless auth with token lifecycles, database design, relational schema design, cache-aware performance optimization, and defensive patterns like distributed rate limiting to keep an API reliable under load.
